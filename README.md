### Project Description

The travel planner project using Google Maps API and Amadeus API is a web application that allows users to efficiently plan their trips and vacations. The application combines the power of two essential APIs to offer a seamless and comprehensive travel planning experience.

Key features of the travel planner project include:

1. Flight Search: The integration of the Amadeus API enables users to search for available flights to their chosen destination. Users can input their departure city, travel dates, and other preferences to find the most convenient and affordable flight options.

2. Accommodation Recommendations: Leveraging data from both Google Maps and Amadeus, the application suggests nearby hotels based on the user's travel destination. Users can browse through different hotel options and their rating along with the distance from the destination airport.

3. Itinerary Planning: Once the user has selected a destination, the application displays nearby restaurants that the user can choose to eat at and the street address of the restaurant.

4. Transportation Search: Users can set a hotel as a destination from the destination airport to search for transportation options along with pricing and vehicle descriptions.

In summary, the travel planner project using Google Maps API and Amadeus API brings together mapping and travel booking functionalities to create a user-friendly and efficient platform for travelers to plan and organize their trips with ease and accuracy. It simplifies the travel planning process and enhances the overall travel experience.
